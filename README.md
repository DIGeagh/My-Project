Project Overview
Image Compression Master is a Python-based application designed to reduce the size of image files, specifically JPEG images, while maintaining their quality. The application aims to make it easier to manage and store large image files by compressing them efficiently.

Key Features
Image Compression: The core functionality of the application is to compress images, which involves reducing their file size while retaining as much of the original quality as possible. This is particularly useful for optimizing images for web use, emailing, or conserving storage space.

Batch Processing: The application supports processing multiple images at once, making it convenient to compress all images within a directory rather than handling each image individually. This batch processing is ordered by the filenames of the images.

Command-Line Interface (CLI): Users can interact with the application via the command line, providing a quick and scriptable way to compress images. Users specify the input and output directories and the desired compression quality through command-line arguments.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): For users who prefer a more visual and user-friendly approach, the application includes a GUI. This interface allows users to select files and directories, set compression quality, and initiate the compression process with a few clicks.

Configuration Management: Default settings for the application, such as the default quality for compression and default directories, are managed through a configuration file. This makes it easy to adjust these settings without modifying the main application code.

Components
Main Script (main.py): This script handles the core functionality of the application, including image compression logic and user interface management. It integrates both CLI and GUI functionalities, making it versatile for different user preferences.

Configuration File (config.py): This file stores default settings for the application. It includes configurations such as the default quality for image compression and default paths for input and output directories.

Requirements File (requirements.txt): This file lists the Python libraries that the application depends on. It includes libraries for image processing and creating the GUI.

Installation and Usage
Installation: Users need to install Python and the required libraries. The installation of dependencies can be automated using the requirements.txt file.

Command-Line Usage: Users can run the application from the command line by specifying the input and output directories and the desired compression quality. This method is quick and suitable for automated scripts or batch processing large numbers of images.

GUI Usage: Users can run the application in GUI mode to visually select the files they want to compress, choose the output directory, and set the compression quality. This method is user-friendly and requires no command-line knowledge.

Example Scenario
Imagine you have a folder full of high-resolution JPEG photos from a recent trip. These photos take up a lot of space on your hard drive. Using Image Compression Master, you can quickly compress all these photos to a more manageable size while still keeping them in good quality. You can either run a single command in the terminal or use the GUI to select the folder and set the desired compression quality.

Contributions
The project is designed to be open for contributions. Users can fork the repository, suggest improvements, and submit pull requests. Bug reports and feature requests can be made through the project's issue tracker.

Summary
Image Compression Master simplifies the process of reducing image file sizes, making it a valuable tool for photographers, web developers, and anyone who needs to manage large collections of images. With both CLI and GUI options, it caters to a wide range of users, from those who prefer automation and scripting to those who prefer a more hands-on, visual approach.
